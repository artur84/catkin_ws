4.- rosservice call /ctrl_node/enable_control true

#DEMO 3: Control the wheelchair with the head (just angular velocity)
1.- Connect the wheelchair and the kinect pointing to the face of the user.
2.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_kinect_face_pose_estimator.launch sim:=0
3.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_head_cmd.launch sim:=0 user_intentions:=0
4.- roslaunch wheelchairconf demo_nav.launch sim:=0
5.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_recognizer.launch sim:=0

#DEMO 4: Control the wheelchair with head and voice
1.- Connect the wheelchair and the kinect pointing to the face of the user.
2.- Make sure to edit ROS_MASTER_URI = localhost and ROS_HOSTNAME = localhost in ~/.bashrc file (is the fastest config to run ROS)
3.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_kinect_face_pose_estimator.launch sim:=0
4.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_voice_and_head_cmd.launch sim:=0 user_intentions:=1
5.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_wheelchair_auto.launch 
6.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_navigation.launch sim:=0 user_intentions:=1 scenario:=hall_inria
7.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_vel_selector.launch sim:=0
8.- roslaunch wheelchairconf start_recognizer.launch sim:=0 corpus:=general

#DEMO 5: Head-voice driving with caregiver following is switch by voice: First connect the wheelchair to the computer, connect the kinect that looks to the front, connect the microphone.

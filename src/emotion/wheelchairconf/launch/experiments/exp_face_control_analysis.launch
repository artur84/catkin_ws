<!-- 	Used to test run all the necessary nodes to perform our study of "user as sensor"						
 		This demo consisted in using the face tracker to read the position and orientation of user's face			
	 	while he is driving the wheelchair with the joystick. the idea is to understand how related is the real control 
		the user gives to the wheelchair with the orientation of the face.  	-->
<!-- author: Arturo Escobedo-->
<!-- PREREQUISITES: 
		The computer where this script will run should be connected to the wheelchair.
		The kinect should be connected to this computer. -->

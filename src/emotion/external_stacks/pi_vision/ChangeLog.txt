Release Notes for Version 0.2.1

* Added three new parameters to avi2ros.py:
	+ "start_paused" (boolean, default False) to launch the video in the paused state which is useful for selecting a patch to track before the video starts
	+ "loop" (boolean, default False) to loop the video continously
	+ "fps" (int, default 25) to set the frames per second of the video

Release Notes for Version 0.2

* Fixed bug in add_features() function that prevented adding of new features(!)

* Fixed bug that caused occasional ROI to be defined outside boundaries of image frame.

* Added new parameter "feature_type" which can be set to 0 for Good Features To Track (default) or 1 for SURF features.

* Added new parameter "use_depth_for_tracking" which causes points to be pruned if their depth value is too far from the currently tracked cloud.

* Changed mask shape from ellipse to rectangle for manually-selected regions; i.e. ellipse-shaped mask only used when parameter auto_face_tracking is set to True.

* Changed default image display window size for ros2opencv from 320x240 to 640x480.

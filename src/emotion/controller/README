How to run examples
===================

1. Launch the demo:
  $ roslaunch pal_launch demo_controller.launch

2. By default control is not enabled. Then you can start the control like this:
  $ rosrun pal_launch start_demo_controller.sh

3. There are 4 type of controller implemented so far:
  - parametric: simple position controller.
                You can set the follower point in any position except for x=0
  - singular: for follower point on y-axis (x=0).
              We assume that the person is moving: the controller stabilizes
              the trajectory. when the person moves. If the person stops, the 
              stabilization neglect the error along y-axis.
  - singular_pos: like singular, but with a take into account the error on
                  y-axis when the person does not move.
  - velocity: improved version of singular.
              Unstable so far, need to be correctly tuned.
Start any of the controller using:
  $ rosrun pal_launch test_<CONTROLLER-NAME>.sh

4. Now you can move the person on stage, or use the "2D Nav Goal" button on rviz

5. To configure gain and dynamically change the follower point position or other
   options use the dynamic_reconfigure:
  $ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui
